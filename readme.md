## Description

A task app that compiles everyday tasks and longer projects in a compact and easy to read format. Add on a friends list to keep track of what they might be up to and check out their public tasks to see if they may need help.

<br/>

Many of my friends use multiple day planners and tracking apps such as Notion, Trello, Google Calendar, etc. Nate and I came up with a way to combine all of the traits we love about these platforms and make it as user friendly and efficient as possible. This design was made as part of Nate's Google UX/UI capstone project and has now become a full fledged website.

## Setup

This project requires a `.env` for the `/backend` folder and that should look similar to this example.
